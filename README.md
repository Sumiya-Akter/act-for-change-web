## Inspiration
We see news about how the Earth is slowly deteriorating every day, and the major cause of this is how careless us humans have been with treating the planet. This is something that people want to work on, but it’s not very easy to delve in a project without the proper funding or guidance like it would be with other issues. So, we wanted to make a page where you have access to the different projects going on in regards to climate change and be able to get connected with like-minded people to make a change.

## What it does
The goal of the [Act For Change](https://sumiya-akter.github.io/act-for-change-web/) website is to inform others about climate change and how it affects us. We also aim to address ways we can help and participate in climate change initiatives.
## How we built it
We used html/css and javascript. We also used the website [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to collaborate on our project
## Challenges we ran into
After we created our website and pushed it onto Github, we noticed that in github pages, some pages weren’t displaying properly even though on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) it was. We altered the head of the html files and after that, our website displayed properly on github pages.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created an entire website with several interactable elements such as a navbar, buttons, interactable images, and forms, etc... in one day.
## What we learned
- How to customize our pages with different layouts.
- Make profile cards to display our information.
- Use bootstrap to make the website more visually appealing.
- How to implement a form in html.
 
## What's next for Act for Change
If we had more time, we would also have liked to implemented interactable graphs, maps, tables, etc.. that updates automatically when the page reloads. We would display important data such as average temperature changes around the world, average sea level changes, extreme weather conditions, etc...
