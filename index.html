          Climate change is the long-term change of Earth's average weather
          patterns. Climate change is closely connected with global warming.

            The problem
          </h3>
          <p>
            Earth's climate is constantly changing and some of these changes are
            attributed to natural changes of our planet. However, recently
            scientists have noticed a dangerous trend that greatly concerns all
            life on Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Earth's average surface temperature has been rising rapidly in
            the last 40 years and 2020 was one was of the warmest years on
            record. This temperature increase has been attributed to human
            activity and our release of carbon dioxide and other gases into the
            air. These gases are known for their ability to trap heat which
            causes the planet's temperature to rise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, following the increase of our planet's surface
            temperature, we are also facing problems such as melting Arctic sea
            ice, rising sea levels, and extreme weather conditions.

              Melting land ice and expanding seawater will cause the sea level
              to rise and lead to major flooding in many regions near the water.

              Some places will encounter heavy precipitation while others will
              face intense droughts and heat waves. Hurricanes and other extreme
              weather will also become more intense and frequent.

            As the dangers of climate change grow clearer, many people and
            organizations have launched climate change efforts and we we can all
            play a part.
